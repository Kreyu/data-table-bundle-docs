# Understanding the Views API

Similar to Symfony Forms, this bundle uses a View classes, that can be used to render the data table.

## The view hierarchy <a href="#the-view-hierarchy" id="the-view-hierarchy"></a>

The `DataTableView` is the root of the view hierarchy. It contains:

* a header row which contains a collection of column headers;
* a collection of value rows, where each contain a collection of column values;
* a collection of filters;
* a collection of actions;
* a pagination;

For example, a data table with three columns, two rows, three filters, three actions and a pagination, will have the following view hierarchy:

```markdown
DataTableView

├── headerRow (HeaderRowView)
│   ├── headerRow.children.0 (ColumnHeaderView)
│   ├── headerRow.children.1 (ColumnHeaderView)
│   └── headerRow.children.2 (ColumnHeaderView)
│
├── nonPersonalizedHeaderRow (HeaderRowView)
│   ├── nonPersonalizedHeaderRow.children.0 (ColumnHeaderView)
│   ├── nonPersonalizedHeaderRow.children.1 (ColumnHeaderView)
│   └── nonPersonalizedHeaderRow.children.2 (ColumnHeaderView)

│   └── value_rows.1 (ValueRowView)
│       ├── valueRows.1.children.0 (ColumnValueView)
│       ├── valueRows.1.children.1 (ColumnValueView)

```

## Reference <a href="#reference" id="reference"></a>

### Header row <a href="#header-row" id="header-row"></a>

The `HeaderRowView` represents a row of headers. It contains two additional properties:

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

If the personalization is enabled, only the columns marked as visible are included in the header row. Because of that, the `nonPersonalizedHeaderRow` property is also available, which represents a row of headers with **all defined columns**, regardless of the visibility applied by the personalization.
{% endhint %}

`parent`

Holds a reference to a `DataTableView`, which represents the whole data table.

`children`

Holds collection of `ColumnHeaderView` instances, so you can use it to render row columns. Instead of accessing the `children` property, you can iterate on the `HeaderRowView` directly:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```twig
{% raw %}
{% for row in header_rows %}
    {% for column in row %}
        {# ... #}
    {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
```
{% endcode %}

### Value row <a href="#value-row" id="value-row"></a>

The `ValueRowView` represents a row of data. It contains five additional properties:

`parent`

Holds a reference to a `DataTableView`, which represents the whole data table.

`children`

Holds collection of `ColumnValueView` instances, so you can use it to render row columns. Instead of accessing the `children` property, you can iterate on the `ValueRowView` directly:

```twig
{% raw %}
{% for row in value_rows %}
    {% for column in row %}
        {# ... #}
    {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
```

`index`

Holds the index of a current row, so you can use it to render a row number:

```twig
{% raw %}
{% for row in value_rows %}
    {{ row.index }}
{% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
```

`data`

Holds the data of a current row, so you can use it to access the data of a row:

```twig
{% raw %}
{% for row in value_rows %}
    {{ row.data.id }}
{% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
```

`origin`

Holds a reference to a `ValueRowView` that was used as an origin of the virtual value row. Virtual value rows are used internally in a [CollectionColumnType](https://data-table-bundle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/philosophy/reference/column-types/collection-column-type.md), where each entry contains its own `ValueRowView` with scoped data and indexes.

### Column header <a href="#column-header" id="column-header"></a>

The `ColumnHeaderView` represents a header of a column. It contains one additional property:

`parent`

Holds a reference to a `HeaderRowView`, which represents the row of data table headers.

### Column value <a href="#column-value" id="column-value"></a>

The `ColumnHeaderView` represents a value of a column. It contains three additional properties:

`parent`

Holds a reference to a `ValueRowView`, which represents the row of data table headers. It can be used to retrieve, for example, an index or data of a row that the column belongs to.

`data`

Holds the norm data of a column. In most cases, this property will equal the `value` property, but in some cases, it will be different. For example, if a column represents an object value, the `value` property will contain a string representation of the object, while the `data` property will contain the object itself.

`value`

Holds the string representation of a column value. In most cases, this property will equal the `data` property, but in some cases, it will be different. For example, if a column has a `formatter` option specified, the `value` property will contain the result of the callable, while the `data` property will contain the original value.

### Filter <a href="#filter" id="filter"></a>

The `FilterView` represents a filter. It is used to render a list of active filters. It contains three additional properties:

`parent`

Holds a reference to a `DataTableView`, which represents the whole data table.

`data`

Holds the data of a filter as an instance of [ FilterData](https://github.com/Kreyu/data-table-bundle/blob/main/src/Filter/FilterData.php) class. It can be used to retrieve both filter value (raw value given by the user) and selected operator.

`value`

Holds the string representation of a filter value. In most cases, this property will equal the value returned by the `FilterData::getValue()` method, but in some cases, it will be different. For example, if a filter has an `active_filter_formatter` option specified, the `value` property will contain the result of the callable.

### Action <a href="#action" id="action"></a>

The `ActionView` represents an action. It contains one additional property:

`parent`

Holds a reference to a `DataTableView`, which represents the whole data table. If the action is used within the [ActionsColumnType](https://data-table-bundle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/columns/types/actions/), then, instead of a reference to a data table, this property holds a reference to a `ColumnValueView`, which can be used to traverse the hierarchy further, for example, to retrieve an instance of `ValueRowView`.
